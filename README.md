Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.2+ datapack intended to remove grass, seagrass, and kelp from natural world generation.

Modified port of "No More Grass and Kelp" datapack. The original datapack is available on Modrinth (https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-more-grass-and-kelp) and its creator is millennIumAMbiguity (https://modrinth.com/user/millennIumAMbiguity)

The project was inspired by Minecraft JE 1.21.2 tag changes which caused existing "No More Grass and Kelp" datapack to stop working past Minecraft JE 1.21.1.

The motivation behind porting this datapack is decluttering heavily-bloated modern Minecraft to retain the soul of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. My dream is to be able to play the newest versions and toggle off everything that doesn't seem vanilla, which cannot be achieved by resourcepacks alone.
